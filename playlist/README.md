## Exposed Interface

  in the playlist.

  respresents a successful response and all items.
- POST /:name
  With a JSON body in the format of {"playlist":["item1","item2",...]}
  will create a new playlist with the given :name, and the listed items (catalog
  ids).
  * {"status":"ok"} means it was created successfully.
  * {"status":"invalid"} with a 412 status code means the operation was unsuccessful,
  such as the playlist name already being in use.
- PUT /:name
  With a JSON body in the format of {"playlist":["item1","item2",...]} will
  replace the playlist with name :name with a different playlist. The operation
  is treated as an overwrite operation for simplicity.

  does not exist.

  * {"status":"ok"} means the operation completed successfully.

  * {"status":"not-found"} If the playlist is not found.
- GET /:name

  * {"status":"ok", "playist":{"name"::name, "length": :len}} where :name is the

# format

Formats the output in preferred format. Currently only m3us, but expect to do
zip files or tars with playlist and files together, and maybe other formats.

## Exposed Interface

- GET /:user/:schedule-name
  For a given :user, return the current playlist for :schedule-name (uses the user
    API for determining current schedule index and auto-increment it).
  * An m3u file with the name:
  :schedule-name - :index.m3u

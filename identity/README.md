  * {"status":"failed", "message":msg} with status code 400 means the user could not
  be created for the reason given in msg.
- PUT /user/:user
  Takes a JSON in the format of {"role":role} where role is a system defined
  role.
  * {"status":"ok"} user role changed.
  * {"status":"failed", "message":msg} with status code 400 means that provided

- GET /user/:user
  Returns the user identity and role for authorization.

  the user.
  * {"status":"not found"} with a 404 means the user is not found.
